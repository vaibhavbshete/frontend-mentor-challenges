## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Working from a pre-rendered design for the first time. It felt good because I didn't have to figure out the colours myself.
I haven't used media queries in the CSS, but have kept it from spilling out of the screen on small screens.

### Continued development

Would improve upon the sizings once I figure out if there is a better option than pixels.

### Useful resources

- [font-size | MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size) - This helped me with font sizes in pixels. Extensive article explaining all units and their meanings.
