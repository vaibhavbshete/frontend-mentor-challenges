## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS Framework
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I have made a bold decision to auto-format the card number as the user types. Vue bindings helped a lot with this one.
Got a bit more familiar with Regular Expressions while achieving this.

### Useful resources
- [RegEx101](https://regex101.com) - This helped me build and test my regular expressions. Very handy tool. Gives detailed explanation about *why* a particular thing was matched.
